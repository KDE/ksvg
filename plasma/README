libplasma

Commit Rules:
* If your patch is not an obvious or trivial bug fix, have it peer reviewed
  by another Plasma developer
* All code MUST follow the kdelibs coding style, as found at:
    http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
* All new public API MUST have apidox written before committing

Unit tests are next to godliness. (Though as you can see, right now libplasma
is hellbound.)

This directory contains the classes making up libplasma, which provides the
core framework used by Plasma and its components. This includes applet and
extension definitions and loading, common GUI elements, etc.

Domain specific sets of functionality, e.g. for network awareness or sensors,
are not found here but in one of the Plasma Engines.

Please refer to the Plasma website (http://plasma.kde.org) and Plasma wiki
(http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma) for API documentation and design
documents regarding this library.
