 *
 * "Wallpapers" are components that paint the background for Containments that
 * do not provide their own background rendering.
 *
 * Wallpaper plugins are registered using .desktop files. These files should be
 * named using the following naming scheme:
 *
 *     plasma-wallpaper-<pluginname>.desktop
 *
 * If a wallpaper plugin provides more than on mode (e.g. Single Image, Wallpaper)
 * it should include a Actions= entry in the .desktop file, listing the possible
 * actions. An actions group should be included to provide for translatable names.
