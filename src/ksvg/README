Commit Guidelines:
* If your patch is not an obvious or trivial bug fix, have it peer reviewed
  by another Frameworks developer; https://phabricator.kde.org is your friend :)

* All code MUST follow the KDE Frameworks coding style, as found at:
        https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Frameworks_Coding_Style

* All new public API MUST have apidox written before committing and must go
  through an API review with another Frameworks developer. We have to maintain
  binary compatibility, remember!

Unit tests are next to godliness.
