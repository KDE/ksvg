/**

 *
 * @short Extends applets to allow detachable parts
 *
 * An Extender is a widget that visually extends the normal contents of an applet with
 * additional dynamic widgets called ExtenderItems. These ExtenderItems can be
 * detached by the user and dropped either on another Extender or on the canvas directly.
 *
 * This widget allows using ExtenderItems in your applet. Extender takes care of the presentation
 * of a collection of ExtenderItems and keeps track of ExtenderItems that originate in it.
 *
 * The default Extender implementation displays extender items in a vertical layout with
 * spacers that appear when dropping an ExtenderItem over it.
 *
 * If you wish to have a different presentation of extender items, you can choose to subclass
 * Extender and reimplement the extenderItem* events and, optionally, the saveState function.
 *
 * To use an Extender in you applet, you'll have to instantiate one. A call to extender() in your
 * applet will create an extender on your applet if you haven't got one already. Every applet can
 * contain only one extender. Think of it as a decorator that adds some functionality to applets
 * that require it. Never instantiate an Extender before init() in your applet. This won't work
 * correctly since a scene is required when an Extender is instantiated.
 *
 * As soon as an Extender is instantiated, ExtenderItems contained previously in this Extender are
 * restored using the initExtenderItem function from the applet the items originally came from. For
 * more information on how this works and how to use ExtenderItems in general, see the ExtenderItem
 * API documentation.
