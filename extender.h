/**
 * An Extender is a widget that visually extends the normal contents of an applet with
 * additional dynamic widgets called ExtenderItems. These ExtenderItems can be
 * detached by the user and dropped either on another Extender or on the canvas directly.
 *
 * This widget allows using ExtenderItems in your applet. Extender takes care of the presentation
 * of a collection of ExtenderItems and keeps track of ExtenderItems that originate in it.
 *
 * The default Extender implementation displays extender items in a vertical layout with
 * spacers that appear when dropping an ExtenderItem over it.
 *
 * If you wish to have a different presentation of extender items, you can choose to subclass
 * Extender and reimplement the extenderItem* events and, optionally, the saveState function.
